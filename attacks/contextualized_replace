## Contextualized replace
- This attack is based on the BERT attack paper. Please refer to the authors' [repository](https://github.com/LinyangLee/BERT-Attack) for setup details. We adjust the original code to work on entailment (pairs for <claim, evidence>)
- To calculate the attack, we use the [BERT stance verification model](https://github.com/S-Abdelnabi/Fact-Saboteurs/tree/main/stance_verification). 
- This attack edits the top retrieved sentences by the attacker's retrieval model.
