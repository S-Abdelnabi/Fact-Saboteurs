# How to reporoduce the attacks on KGAT

- For details on how to set up the KGAT environment, in addition to more details about how it generally works regardless of the attacks, please refer to the KGAT's [repository](https://github.com/thunlp/KernelGAT)


- To run the attacks on KGAT you first need to compute the attacks, or use our already computed attacks in the [data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xbSzefjPm4Ii5WQSKX2C5wT5MydBkqcT?usp=sharing) directory. 

- The KGAT pipeline first runs the retrieval. Then the verification step.
